VIM-RUNTIME                                                      *vim-runtime*

A quick reference for some of the shortcuts that I've have installed for various
operations in my Vim configuration.

                                                                     *HomeGit*
Git shortcuts (prefix <C-g>):

    <C-g>f        Show a list of all Git commited files (git ls-files) using FZF
    <C-g>s        Show a list of all files mentioned in `git status` using FZF
    <C-g>l        Show a list of commits, equivalent to `git log`, using FZF
    <C-g>h        Open a QuickFix list for all the hunks in the diff from HEAD,
                  (i.e `git diff HEAD`)
    <C-g>j        Open a QuickFix list for all the hunks in the diff from HEAD~1,
                  (i.e `git diff HEAD~1`)
    <C-g>d        Split view of `git diff HEAD`
    <C-g>n        Split view of `git diff HEAD --cached` or what to be commited)
    <C-g>o        Split view of `git show HEAD`
    <C-g>p        Split view of the commit currently being cherry-picked
                  (useful during conflict resolution in rebases)
    <C-g>Q        Open up the list of unmerged conflicts in a QuickFix list

  Various operations:

    <C-g>c        Do a 'git checkout' to another branch
    <C-g>a        Do `git commit -a` using vim-fugitive
    <C-g>AA       Do `git commit --amend -a` using vim-fugitive
    <C-g>PP       Do `git push` so that tracking branch is updated
    <C-g>y        Do `git commit` using vim-fugitive
    <C-g>k        Reset to previous commit and unstage current commit changes
                  (the reversal of `git commit`)

  Related to current file:

    <C-g><CR>     Show a list of commits (`git log`) for the current file using
                  FZF
    <C-g>r        Unstage current file (equivalent to a `git reset` on the file)

  Hunk related:

    <C-g><Down>   Go down to closest unstaged hunk
    <C-g><Up>     Go up to closest unstaged hunk

    Opertions:

    <C-g><Backspace>  Equivalent to a `checkout -p` of the hunk related
                      to the cursor position and `git diff HEAD~1`. Effectively,
                      a revert of a specific change from `git diff HEAD~1`. Handy
		      after using `<C-g>j`.
    <C-g><Del>        Delete unstaged current hunk
    <C-g><Ins>        Stage current hunk

  Conflict hunk related:

    <C-g>b        Go to previous conflict hunk
    <C-g>t        Go to next conflict hunk

    Operations:

    <C-g>q<Del>   Take none of the changes
    <C-g>q<Up>    Take the upper one
    <C-g>q<Down>  Take the lower one
    <C-g>q<CR>    Take both of them
